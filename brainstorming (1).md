TOP 3 IDEAS (in no particular order):

1. Vivian: Using a recipe API to make an app for quick recipes (https://apilist.fun/api/food-api or https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
    **Category:**: Food/Home
    **Mobile**: This app would mainly provide ease of access because if someone is cooking, having a whole laptop out for a recipe might be a lot. In addition, people can quickly see multiple ideas.
    **Story**: When walking around the grocery store, it would be easy to just scroll through and find something quick to make. It would be easy and efficient for people to use.
    **Market**: The market is large because everyone needs food, so everyone could use this. It's especially convenient for people who are on the go (i.e. office workers, etc) so they can look for recipes while commuting. 
    **Habit**: This is very habit forming because people can endlessly scroll for receipes and can save the receipes that they like. People need receipes for food everyday, so this would be used often.
    **Scope**: A stripped down version would be having a recycler view with endless scroll of random recipes (click on the recipe and the directions will pop up in a page) and a save function where people can look at the receipes they saved. This should be fine to complete by the deadline, especially by using previous projects for reference. This is clearly defined as a recipe app.

2.  Erlisja: Movie Database API:
https://www.omdbapi.com/
Offer movie information, reviews, ratings, and showtimes using a movie database API like IMDb or The Movie Database (TMDb).
   - **Category:** Movie  
    **Mobile**:the app is view only. The user can search for the top rated movies,the cast or year of release. The app will offer trailers for the movies.
    **Story**: The app will offer the user the possibility to search for their favorite movie and learn more information about it or take a look at the ratings first before deciding to watch a movie.
    **Market**:This is an app for all movie lovers and for those who decide to spend a night in front of the TV but are not sure what movie to watch.
    **Habit**: This app is habit forming because the users can always use the app before deciding what movie to watch.
    **Scope**: This app would be more like a database of movies,containing all information related to that specific movie that the user is searching. Completing this app by the deadline would be somewhat chellenging.

 3. Nobel: Sneaker API to search/sell/trade diffrent shoes (https://rapidapi.com/belchiorarkad-FqvHs2EDOtP/api/sneaker-database-stockx)
    **Category:**: Clothing
    **Mobile**: This app will offer a all in one place where users can buy/sell/trade there favorite sneakers and learn infomation about various sneakers that are in the market 
    **Story**: This app will provide value not only to sneaker resellers but anyone who are interested in any shoe. 
    **Market**: This app has a big market, this app will be for anyone who is interested to shoes but mainly for people who are in the sneakers market whether that be designer sneakers or sport sneakers. 
    **Habit**: This can be addicive app if frequently updated on the shoes market, users will constantly search for the newest releases of shoes. 
    **Scope**: This poentially can be challenging app to complete by the dead line, would probably would need to use more then just this API if we want it to be app similar to stock x. 


Final Idea for App:
    - Name: Random Recipe!
    - API used: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
    - Description: Our main functionality will be an endless scroll of random recipes. If a person clicks on a recipe in the recycler view, more information will pop up along with the actual recipe directions. The person will be able to save the recipe that they like and in another page, saved recipes will be shown.
